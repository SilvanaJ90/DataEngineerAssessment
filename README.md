## General project requirements

Investment commercial managers oversee a large number of clients, and the information they have about these clients comes from various sources and with unconventional codes, making it difficult for them to extract knowledge from the available information and generate new investment opportunities in a more automated way. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an analytical tool that allows them to visualize at a minimum:
- The portfolio of each client and what percentage each macro-asset and asset represents in the total portfolio, considering the latest available date.
- The portfolio by banking sector and what percentage each macro-asset represents, considering the latest available date.
- The portfolio by risk profile and what percentage each macro-asset represents, considering the latest available date.
- The month-to-month evolution of the average ABA (Assets Under Management) of the total portfolio. It is desirable to be able to select start and end dates to determine the period to be analyzed.

## Postgres storage

Postgres database, an O.R.M storage was implemented with sqlalchemy

This project has a console that allows you to create, update, delete, insert data into 
- [The database using the following commands ](https://github.com/SilvanaJ90/DataEngineerAssessment/blob/main/setup_postgres_dev.sql)



## SQL Queries Development: 

- [To insert the CSV data into the database, use the following script](https://github.com/SilvanaJ90/DataEngineerAssessment/blob/main/connection.py).
